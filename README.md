# Coupa_Automation

Since I'm not a professional python developer, I'll be really grateful for every suggestion or guidance.

**If you are not fammiliar with selenium:**
  - you have to download the newset chromedriver from this site https://chromedriver.chromium.org/home
  - Then crate folder in you project folder called /driver and add unzipped file there

**If you want to use it correctly, you have to enable downloading pdf's in Chrome settings**


## This program automates downloading invoices from Coupa website.

Program features:
  -It has gui because it's made for windows users who are accountant and are not familiar with python.
  -It accepts only list copied form excel file
  -(It probably has a lot of bugs)
  -If you are using Coupa, it can save you a huge amount of time
